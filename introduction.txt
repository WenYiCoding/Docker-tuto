Create a js file

Run the file using NodeJs
 - like Java file need JRE to execute

By theory, other environment also need to install NodeJs
 - because of this, "this only works on my machine" condition exist

If we got new environment, we need
 - install Operating System
 - install running environment (NodeJs)
 - install all compiled/source files
 - install all program dependencies if needed
 - install program config files
 - then can execute the program

Docker can prevent "only works on my machine" and automate all installation in new environement
 - also force disipline on tracking the environment configuration

Install Docker Desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
 - require wsl if on windows
 -- > wsl --install
 - require virtualization enabled in boot setting
 - if have issue, set UMA buffer size to Auto

Create "Dockerfile"
 - no file extension (like .js)
 - always capitalize follow the capitalization
